## General info
The object of this project is to Python code implementations of transportation
applications, e.g., North-West Corner Method, transportation plan optimization
with non-basic variables, travel distribution between zones.
The code is going to be part of a transportation apps book writen by a group of
authors.

## Technologies
* Python3 with math module
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* scipy
* Jupyter Notebook, etc.
* Code static typed

## Setup
Just read the docstrings and comments. Also pay attention to matrices
dimensions.

## Code Examples
Show examples of usage:
`class GravitMod()`

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* ~~Write README.md file~~
* ~~Code North-West Corner Method~~
* Code Least Cost Method
* Code Vogel Method
* Code the balancing script
* Code the Russels allocation
* Code optimization with non-basic variables
* Code optimization with Stepping Stone Method
* Code Hungarian Method for resources allocation
* Code Transportation Plan Greedy Optimization
* and many more will be updated as the work progresses.

## Status
Project is: _in progress_

## Inspiration
